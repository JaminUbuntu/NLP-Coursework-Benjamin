# 💬 Semantic Analysis on Twitter User Data using Hybrid Embedding Models  
*A Traditional Machine Learning Approach for Sentiment Classification*

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the application of **Hybrid Embedding Models**—a synthesis of **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**—to perform sentiment classification on tweets. Developed as part of Coventry University's 7120CEM Natural Language Processing coursework, it classifies Twitter posts into *Positive*, *Neutral*, and *Negative* sentiment categories.

By integrating statistical and contextual textual representations, we aim to enhance classification accuracy using **Traditional Machine Learning Models** such as **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. The dataset is drawn from the **SemEval-2017 Task 4A**, comprising over 20,000 labeled tweets. Text preprocessing, hybrid feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are systematically executed.

The final models have relevance in real-world applications such as **brand monitoring**, **public opinion mining**, and **social behavior analytics**—demonstrating the practical value of academic NLP.

## ❓ FAQ / Known Issues

- **Q: Why does Word2Vec underperform on its own?**  
  A: It requires larger training corpora to capture rich semantics effectively.

- **Q: Can this scale to multilingual tweets?**  
  A: Yes, with multilingual Word2Vec models and Unicode-aware preprocessing.

- **Q: Why use Traditional ML and not Deep Learning?**  
  A: To explore interpretable and lightweight models as a baseline.
